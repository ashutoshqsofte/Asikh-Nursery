        <p className="plant">
          Plant care involves several key practices to keep them healthy and thriving. Water consistently but avoid overwatering, adjusting based on the plant type and season. Ensure the plant gets the right light, whether full sun, partial shade, or low light. Use nutrient-rich, well-draining soil to support growth and fertilize during the growing season for added nutrients. Prune regularly to remove dead or damaged parts and maintain a healthy structure. Keep temperature and humidity levels suitable for the plant's needs, as some thrive in specific conditions. Lastly, monitor for pests and address issues quickly. Research your plant's
          unique requirements for the best care.</p>

        <h1>Landscaping design</h1>
        <p>Focus on creating a balance between functionality and aesthetics. Choose plants suited to the local climate, and use a mix of textures and colors for visual appeal. Incorporate hardscaping elements like pathways or patios for structure. Ensure proper irrigation and drainage for plant health. Opt for sustainable practices, such as water-efficient plants and eco-friendly materials. Plan for seasonal maintenance to keep the landscape vibrant year-round. Lastly, design spaces that suit your lifestyle and outdoor activities.</p>

        <h1>Garden maintenance</h1>

Water plants as needed, avoiding overwatering, and remove weeds regularly to prevent them from competing for nutrients. Prune dead or overgrown branches to promote healthy growth and shape plants. Enrich the soil with compost or organic matter to maintain its fertility and structure. Use mulch to retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed growth. Fertilize plants during their growing season to boost their growth. Adjust care routines according to the season, such as protecting plants from frost in winter or providing shade during hot summers. Monitor for pests and address them promptly. Keep your lawn healthy with regular mowing, aeration, and weed control. Finally, ensure your gardening tools are clean and sharp for effective use. With consistent care, your garden will thrive and look its best throughout the year.</p>
